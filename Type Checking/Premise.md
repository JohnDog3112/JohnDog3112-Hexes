If you break down each individual spell or pattern into it's inputs/outputs you essentially have a type system. While some can take ANY as an input, such as the contents of a list, the duplication pattern, or jester's gambit (swapping pattern).

So, at least at a basic level, you could track type production/consumption and check that everything works out throughout the entire program.
